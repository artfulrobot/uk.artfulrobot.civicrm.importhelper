You can also have it create\ncontacts when you have decided they need to be.\n\n\nIt tries to be helpful by looking for matches for you, based on name and email.\nIf it finds a single matching contact it will auto-select that, otherwise it\nwill offer you options, e.g. \"Same email: Wilma Flintstone\", or \"Similar name:\nBetty Rubble\".\n\n\nAlso it only shows you distinct sets of first, last names and emails. So if your\ndata has a bunch of records from Wilma Flintstone, you'll only have to locate\nWilma once.\n\n\nWhen everything is matched up, you can download the CSV file again, which will\nbe the same file as you fed into it, but now it has an extra \"Internal ID\"\ncolumn with the CiviCRM Contact ID populated.\n\n\nThen\n you can use that in CiviCRM's normal import routines for contacts,\nactivities, contributions...\n\n\nSound good?\n\n\nSee \nInstallation\n and then jump across to \nUsage\n\n\nArtful Robot wrote this\n\n\nThat's me.
