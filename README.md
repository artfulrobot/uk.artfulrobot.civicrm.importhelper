# CSV Import Helper tool

This is a native CiviCRM version of an older Drupal-based tool that has proved
very useful to my clients.

## Installing and Requirements

You can install this in the normal way.

This extension has been written against CiviCRM 4.7 with PHP 5.6 (multibyte
string functions required) and MariaDB 10.0 (MariaDB is a drop-in replacement
for MySQL that I have found to be more performant than MySQL for CiviCRM, a
recent version of MySQL should work just as well), it requires InnoDB and UTF-8
support.

Any problems running against other versions please submit an issue and ideally 
a pull request :-)


## Use
