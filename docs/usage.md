# Usage

The steps are:

1. Do a little initial tweaking of your spreadsheet and save as CSV.

2. Upload your CSV spreadsheet and process it.

3. Download the new version with the matched contacts.

## Initial tweaking

You need to make the first four columns of your spreadsheet contain, in this
order:

1. Title
2. First name (can be the only name field)
3. Last name
4. Email

So you may need to rearrange your spreadsheet columns a bit to fit. **Don't
worry if some of these are blank** - e.g. if you don't have titles, names or
emails for some rows. Obviously you'll need *something* in there, but it's fine
if your data just has emails, or just has names, for example.

Nb. If your data has a single "Name" column instead of separate first and last
names, stick that in column 2 (or "B" in spreadsheet land) - the one for first name.
