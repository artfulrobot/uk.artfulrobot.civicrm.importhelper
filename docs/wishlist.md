Here's some features I think might be useful. If you want these please create a
feature request in the [Issue
queue](https://github.com/artfulrobot/uk.artfulrobot.civicrm.importhelper/issues).
If you can [submit a PR](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/),
even better! Or if you want to [hire me to develop a new
feature](https://artfulrobot.uk), just ask and I'll do you a quote.

- Add a button to create a new contact when there's several similar candidates.

- Use it with organisations as well as individuals.

- Add a "Make new contact" button on a per-row basis, instead or as well as the
  button that does it for *all* missing contacts at once.

- It would be nice to have an option to insert names from CiviCRM's into the
  outputted name columns instead of the input data.
